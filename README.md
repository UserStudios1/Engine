# Engine
This is a basic Engine that is primarly used for displaying Graphics and is currently in development and therefor in a very early stage of development. Please keep that in mind.

# Note:
You need to compile the Engine yourself, Goodluck!
I have been able to only get it to run in Debug mode in Visual Studio 2022.
